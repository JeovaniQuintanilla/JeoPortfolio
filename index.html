                    I’m a recent graduate of Farmingdale State College, where
                    I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Networking in Spring 2025.
                    I'm very passionate about both coding and designing, especially in front-end developing, as it
                    combines
                    my
                    interests in both technology and drawing. I've worked on a few personal projects that showcase this
                    passion.
                    I hope to carry those skills with me as I continue to grow in my career.
                    While I’m still improving my skills in front-end development, I’m also interested in exploring
                    back-end
                    work
                    to better understand how everything functions behind the scenes. I enjoy seeing how different
                    technologies connect and work together to create complete,
                    meaningful projects.

                    My goals are becoming a valuable contributor as a programmer,
                    becoming certified in DevOps, and eventually pursuing a Master’s degree.
